# Flyff universe multi-tab spell caster

A helpful tool for the web browser version of the Flyff Universe to cast spells from another tab.

Use this tool to cast your healer's spells from the tab where you play your main character.

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your favorite web browser.
2. Go to this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pPrecel/flyff-universe-multi-tab-spell-caster/main/script.user.js) location. Tampermonkey will automatically detect it.
3. Enjoy.

## Usage

1. In the first tab login into your healers account and click the `/` symbol on the keyboard. The tool will communicate that it's ready for instructions.
2. In the second tab login into the main char that you would play. Now you can manage the first account passing the right key combination (ctrl + symbol).

## Hints

1. Healers should follow your main char. You can do it by targeting the main one and pressing `z` on your keyboard.
2. Split your screen between two account tabs. It would give you more control over both chars. Remember this tool is definitely safer to use than any bot because there is no auto-magic. Still, the game can tell you to react to the captcha.

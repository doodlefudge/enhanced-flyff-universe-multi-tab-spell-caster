# Flyff universe multi-tab spell caster

A helpful tool for the web browser version of the Flyff Universe to cast spells from another tab.

Use this tool to cast your slave's spells from the tab where you play your master character.

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in your favorite web browser.
2. Go to this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pPrecel/flyff-universe-multi-tab-spell-caster/main/script.user.js) location and install it. Tampermonkey will automatically detect it.
3. Enjoy.

## Usage

1. In the first tab login into your slave account and click the `/` symbol on the keyboard. The tool will communicate that it's ready for instructions.
2. In the second tab login into the master char that you would play. Now you can manage the first account passing the right key combination (`ctrl+symbol`).

## Hints

1. Slaves should follow your master char. You can do it by targeting the master one and pressing `z` on your keyboard.
2. Split your screen between two account tabs. It would give you more control over both chars. Remember this tool is definitely safer to use than any bot because there is no auto-magic. Still, the game can tell you to react to the captcha.
3. If you want to cast masters and slaves at the same time (using the same key) you can locate the target master's spell under key `ctrl+number` and the slave's spell under `number`. After passing the `ctrl+number` combination on the keyboard gave will cast spells on both tabs.
4. Using this tool you can pass any commands to the slaves' tabs. Remember you can't trigger key combinations like `ctrl`, `alt`, or `shift` on the slave's tab.
